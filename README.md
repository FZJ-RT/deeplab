# deeplab
A library for an implementation of DeepLabV3+ model for analyzing microfluidics experiments

## Introduction
'deeplab' provides an implementation of DeepLabV3+ model used for a comparison in our paper. It uses [Keras](https://keras.io/) version 3 for the DeepLabV3+ implementation and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). Some functions in our 'cac' libary are used here. We enable a training with GPU using [Horovod](https://horovod.ai/). 

## Getting started
